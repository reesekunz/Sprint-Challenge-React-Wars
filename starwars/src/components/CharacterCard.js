// Step 1 - Create component folder and files after laying out/designing file structure

// App contains CharacterComponent. CharacterComponent contains CharacterCard. CharacterCard contains name and gender (from api) so don't need more imports below - go back and add more character attributes later.









export default CharacterCard;
